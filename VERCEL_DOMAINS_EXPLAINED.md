# üåê Vercel Domains Explained - Why You Have Two URLs

## üéØ What You Discovered

‚úÖ **https://frontend-7bc4py1y1-info-36621003s-projects.vercel.app** - PERFECT! Dice works!
‚ùå **https://ape-in-game.vercel.app** - OLD version, dice bug still present

## üìä How Vercel Works

Vercel gives you TWO types of URLs:

### 1. **Preview/Deployment URLs** (Temporary)
Format: `frontend-XXXXX-yourproject.vercel.app`

Examples:
- `frontend-7bc4py1y1-info-36621003s-projects.vercel.app` ‚Üê Your LATEST
- `frontend-4xnaz3p9g-info-36621003s-projects.vercel.app` ‚Üê Previous
- `frontend-aj9abomx5-info-36621003s-projects.vercel.app` ‚Üê Even older

**Purpose:**
- Each time you deploy, you get a NEW preview URL
- Perfect for testing before making it live
- These URLs are temporary/for preview

### 2. **Production Domain** (Permanent)
Format: `your-project-name.vercel.app`

Your domain: `ape-in-game.vercel.app`

**Purpose:**
- This is your MAIN public URL
- Always points to the "production" deployment
- This is what you share with users
- Stays the same forever

---

## ‚ùå The Problem

When you run `vercel --prod`, it creates a new preview URL but **doesn't automatically update the main domain**.

The main domain (`ape-in-game.vercel.app`) is still pointing to an OLD deployment (without the dice fix).

---

## ‚úÖ The Solution

You need to **promote** your latest deployment to be the production domain.

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (Easiest - 2 Minutes)

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your **"frontend"** or **"ape-in-game"** project
3. Click on it
4. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
5. Find the deployment: `frontend-7bc4py1y1...` (the one that works!)
6. Click the **"..."** menu on that deployment
7. Click **"Promote to Production"**
8. Confirm

**Done!** Now `ape-in-game.vercel.app` will point to the fixed version!

### Option 2: Assign Domain via Settings

1. Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your project
2. **Settings** ‚Üí **Domains**
3. Find `ape-in-game.vercel.app`
4. Make sure it's set as **Production** domain
5. If not, click **"Edit"** ‚Üí Set to **Production**

### Option 3: Redeploy to Main Project

The issue might be that "frontend" is a different project than "ape-in-game".

Check in Vercel dashboard:
- Do you have TWO projects?
  - `frontend` (where new deploys go)
  - `ape-in-game` (your main domain)

If yes, you need to either:
- Delete the old `ape-in-game` project and rename `frontend` to `ape-in-game`
- Or deploy directly to the `ape-in-game` project

---

## üîß Quick Fix Command

If you want to force update the main domain:

```bash
cd /home/apedev/ape-in-bot/frontend

# Link to the ape-in-game project specifically
npx vercel link

# Then deploy to production
npx vercel --prod
```

When it asks to link:
- Link to existing project? **Y**
- Select: **ape-in-game** (not "frontend")

---

## üìä Current Situation

| URL | Version | Dice Fix | Use This? |
|-----|---------|----------|-----------|
| `ape-in-game.vercel.app` | OLD | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå Don't use yet |
| `frontend-7bc4py1y1...` | LATEST | ‚úÖ YES | ‚úÖ Use this now! |
| `localhost:3000` | LATEST | ‚úÖ YES | ‚ö†Ô∏è Firefox issues |

## üéØ What You Should Do

### Immediate (Share This URL):
**https://frontend-7bc4py1y1-info-36621003s-projects.vercel.app**

This works perfectly! Share this with anyone who wants to play.

### Permanent Fix (Update Main Domain):
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Promote the `frontend-7bc4py1y1` deployment to production
3. OR assign `ape-in-game.vercel.app` domain to the frontend project

---

## üîÑ Going Forward

Each time you deploy with `npx vercel --prod`:
- You get a NEW preview URL (frontend-XXXXX...)
- The main domain (`ape-in-game.vercel.app`) doesn't auto-update
- You need to manually promote OR configure it to auto-update

**To auto-update the main domain:**
1. Make sure you're deploying to the correct project
2. Set up automatic production deployments in Vercel settings

---

## üöÄ Recommended Setup

**For Now:**
- Share: `https://frontend-7bc4py1y1-info-36621003s-projects.vercel.app`
- This works perfectly!

**For Later:**
- Fix Vercel project configuration
- Make `ape-in-game.vercel.app` auto-update
- Then you can always share the same URL

---

## üí° Why This Happened

You probably deployed the `frontend` folder as a separate project, but `ape-in-game.vercel.app` was already created as a different project earlier.

Now you have TWO Vercel projects:
1. `ape-in-game` (old, on the main domain)
2. `frontend` (new, getting all the updates)

**Solution:** Merge them or update the domain assignment!

---

**Bottom line: The dice fix IS working on the latest deployment! Just use the new URL or update the main domain assignment in Vercel dashboard.** üéØ
