## How to Update Scores

If you want to change the winning scores, edit:

**Backend:** `backend/app/config.py`
```python
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    MAX_SCORE: int = 150  # Change this
    MAX_ROUNDS: int = 10   # Or this
```

**Per-Game Customization:** `backend/app/services/game_service.py`
```python
# In create_game method:
if mode == "sandy":
    winning_score = 150
elif mode in ["aida", "lana", "enj1n", "nifty"]:
    winning_score = 300
```

## Current Generic Text (Works for All)

Frontend now says:
> "Save your score by stacking. Reach the target sats to win!"

This works for all game modes since the target varies!
