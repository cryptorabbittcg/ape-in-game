# 🎮 Complete Game Logic Implementation Plan

## ✅ Requirements Summary

### Turn Flow:
1. Player draws card → Card image displays
2. Player must roll dice
3. Roll 2-6 → Sats added to turn score → Choose: Draw again OR Stack
4. Roll 1 → BUST → Turn score reset → Turn passes to bot
5. Stack sats → Turn score added to total → Turn passes to bot

### Special Cards:
- **Bearish Cards:** Roll to dodge (even=safe, odd=penalty applies)
- **Ape In!:** Auto-draw next card, if value card + successful roll = DOUBLE sats
- **Ape In! Prevention:** Can't draw Ape In! twice in a row

### UI Needs:
- ✅ Card images from /assets/cards/
- ✅ Cardback image for deck
- ✅ Both Total Sats and Turn Sats displayed
- ✅ Player name input
- ✅ Proper button enable/disable states
