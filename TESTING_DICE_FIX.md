# 🧪 Testing the Dice Animation Fix

## ⚠️ Important: Clear Your Browser Cache!

The error you're seeing:
```
SyntaxError: The requested module doesn't provide an export named: 'GameMode'
```

**This is a BROWSER CACHE issue!** The export exists, but your browser is using old cached files.

### Method 3: Incognito/Private Window (Guaranteed)

## 🎯 Testing the Dice Fix

Once the cache is cleared:

### Step 1: Open Console
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Press `F12`
3. Click **Console** tab

### Step 2: Start a Game
1. Click "Sandy" mode
2. Enter your name
3. Click "Draw Card"
4. Click "Roll Dice"

### Step 3: Trigger Sandy's Turn
- Either **bust** (roll a 1)
- Or **stack your sats**

### Step 4: Watch Sandy's Turn Carefully

You should see this sequence:

```
✅ CORRECT SEQUENCE:
────────────────────
1. "Sandy's turn..." message
   → Dice: NOT rolling yet
   → Label: "Dice"

2. Sandy draws card
   → Card flips
   → Dice: STILL not rolling
   → Label: "Dice"
   → Console: shouldRoll = false

3. Card is visible (pause)
   → Dice: STILL not rolling
   → Label: "Dice"

4. "Sandy rolls..." message
   → Dice: NOW starts rolling!
   → Label: "Rolling..."
   → Console: shouldRoll = true

5. Dice shows result (e.g., 4)
   → Dice: Stops, shows number
   → Label: "Dice"
   → Console: shouldRoll = false
```

### Step 5: Check Console Logs

Look for messages like:
```javascript
🎲 Dice Debug: {
  isBotPlaying: true,
  isRolling: false,
  botTurnDataIsRolling: false,  // Should be FALSE during draw
  shouldRoll: false,              // Should be FALSE during draw
  botRoll: null,
  lastRoll: 3
}
```

During draw: `shouldRoll` should be `false`
During roll: `shouldRoll` should be `true`

## ❌ What You Were Seeing (Bug)

```
❌ BUGGY SEQUENCE:
──────────────────
1. Sandy draws card
   → Dice: STARTS ROLLING ❌ (TOO EARLY!)
   → Label: "Rolling..." ❌

2. Then dice rolls again when "Sandy rolls..." 
   → Rolling TWICE ❌
```

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Still See the GameMode Error?
- Browser cache not cleared properly
- Try Incognito window (guaranteed fresh)

### Dice Still Rolling During Draw?
- Check console logs - what does `shouldRoll` show?
- If `shouldRoll = false` but dice is rolling → different issue
- If `shouldRoll = true` during draw → state logic issue

### Console Logs Not Appearing?
- Make sure you're in Console tab (not Elements)
- Logs only appear during bot's turn
- Only when `isBotPlaying` is true

## 📊 What Each Test URL Has

| URL | Has Dice Fix | Has Debug Logs | Browser Cache |
|-----|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| http://localhost:3000 | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | ⚠️ Need to clear |
| Vercel latest | ✅ YES | ❌ No | ⚠️ Need to clear |

## 🎮 After Cache is Cleared

The game should work perfectly with:
- Smooth card flip animation
- Dice staying still during card draw
- Dice rolling only when roll function is called
- Perfect timing and sequencing

## 🆘 If Still Broken After Cache Clear

Share the console logs showing:
```
🎲 Dice Debug: {...}
```

I'll use those exact values to find the issue!

**TL;DR:** Clear your browser cache with Ctrl+Shift+R or open Incognito window! 🚀
