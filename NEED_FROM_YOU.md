# 📋 What I Need From You

## 🎴 Card Back Image

**To complete the card deck visual:**

I need a **cardback image** to show on the deck before cards are flipped.

### Where to put it:
Save the cardback image file in:
```
/home/apedev/Downloads/
```

### Name it:
- `cardback.png` or `cardback.jpg`
- Or any name - just let me know what it's called

### I'll then:
1. Copy it to `frontend/public/assets/`
2. Display it on the undrawn deck
3. Animate the flip from cardback → card face

## ✅ Once You Provide That:

I'll implement:
- ✅ Full game logic (all 9 rules you specified)
- ✅ Card images displaying correctly  
- ✅ Cardback → flip animation
- ✅ Proper turn flow
- ✅ Bearish card logic
- ✅ Ape In! double sats logic
- ✅ Player name input
- ✅ Total vs Turn sats display
- ✅ Bot AI turn progression

---

**For now, I can use a placeholder cardback. Let me start implementing the logic!** 🚀
