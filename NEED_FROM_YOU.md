# ðŸ“‹ What I Need From You

## ðŸŽ´ Card Back Image

**To complete the card deck visual:**

I need a **cardback image** to show on the deck before cards are flipped.

### Where to put it:
Save the cardback image file in:
```
/home/apedev/Downloads/
```

### Name it:
- `cardback.png` or `cardback.jpg`
- Or any name - just let me know what it's called

### I'll then:
1. Copy it to `frontend/public/assets/`
2. Display it on the undrawn deck
3. Animate the flip from cardback â†’ card face

## âœ… Once You Provide That:

I'll implement:
- âœ… Full game logic (all 9 rules you specified)
- âœ… Card images displaying correctly  
- âœ… Cardback â†’ flip animation
- âœ… Proper turn flow
- âœ… Bearish card logic
- âœ… Ape In! double sats logic
- âœ… Player name input
- âœ… Total vs Turn sats display
- âœ… Bot AI turn progression

---

**For now, I can use a placeholder cardback. Let me start implementing the logic!** ðŸš€
