## 🔧 **WHAT REMAINS:**

### **Complete Game Logic Implementation**

**The 9 Detailed Requirements:**

1. ⏳ **Card Images Display** - Show actual images with flip from cardback

3. ⏳ **Score Display** - Both Total Sats and Turn Sats
4. ⏳ **Dice Roll Logic** - 1=bust (turn ends), 2-6=success (add sats)
5. ⏳ **Bearish Card Dodge** - Even roll=dodge, odd roll=penalty applies
6. ⏳ **Ape In! Double Sats** - Auto-draw next, double if value card
7. ⏳ **Bot AI Turns** - Sandy plays automatically after player
8. ⏳ **Player Name Input** - Modal for name entry
9. ⏳ **Complete Testing** - End-to-end game flow verification

**Estimated Time:** 60-90 minutes of focused implementation
