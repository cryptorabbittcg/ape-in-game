## üß™ Testing Your Deployment

After both services have redeployed:

1. Visit: https://ape-in-game.vercel.app/
2. You should see the Ape In! home page with game modes
3. Click **Sandy** to start a game
4. Try drawing cards and rolling dice
5. The game should work perfectly!

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Frontend shows blank page
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for errors
- Check if `VITE_API_URL` environment variable was added
- Make sure you redeployed after adding the variable

### CORS errors in browser console
- Make sure Render `CORS_ORIGINS` includes your Vercel domain or is set to `*`
- Wait for Render to finish redeploying after changing the variable

### Backend "Application Error"
- Check Render logs for specific errors
- Make sure `greenlet` is in `requirements.txt`
- Verify all environment variables are set correctly

### Network timeout errors
- Render free tier may sleep after inactivity
- First request after sleep takes 30-60 seconds
- This is normal for free tier
