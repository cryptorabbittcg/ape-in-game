- ✅ Cardback image (`Ape-In-Cardback.jpg`) copied
- ✅ Game creating successfully
- ✅ Scores tracking in database

---

## 🔧 **WHAT I'M IMPLEMENTING NOW:**

Based on your 9-point detailed specification:

### 1. **Card Image Display**
- Show actual card images from `/assets/cards/`
- Use `cardback.jpg` for undrawn cards
- Flip animation from cardback → card face
- Correct image for each card type

### 2. **Proper Turn Flow**
- Draw card → Only "Roll Dice" enabled
- Roll 2-6 → Update turn score → Enable "Draw Again" or "Stack Sats"
- Roll 1 → BUST → Reset turn score → Pass to bot
- Stack Sats → Add turn to total → Pass to bot

### 3. **Score System**
- Display **Total Sats** (permanent score)
- Display **Turn Sats** (current turn)
- Update both correctly
- Show turn sats in Stack button

### 4. **Bearish Card Logic**
- Draw Bearish → Must roll to dodge
- Roll EVEN (2,4,6) → Dodge! Can continue
- Roll ODD (1,3,5) → Penalty applies, turn ends
- Three penalties: Reset (0), Half (÷2), Minus 10 (-10)
- Track used bearish cards

### 5. **Ape In! Mechanic**
- Draw Ape In! → Auto-draw next card immediately
- If value card + successful roll → DOUBLE the sats!
- If bearish card → Normal bearish logic
- Prevent Ape In! drawing twice in a row
- Exciting message: "🚀 APE IN ACTIVATED! DOUBLE SATS!"

### 6. **Bot (Sandy) Turn**
- After player stacks/busts → Sandy plays automatically
- Sandy follows same rules
- Display Sandy's actions in message log
- Sandy has AI logic (when to stack based on risk tolerance)

### 7. **Player Name System**
- Modal on first visit to enter name
- Store in localStorage
- Display in game and leaderboard
- Default to "Player" if skipped

### 8. **Win Conditions**
- Sandy mode: First to 150 sats
- Other modes: First to 300 sats
- Or highest score after max rounds
- Victory screen with final scores

### 9. **Polish & UX**
- Proper button states (enabled/disabled)
- Loading states during actions
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Smooth animations for all actions
