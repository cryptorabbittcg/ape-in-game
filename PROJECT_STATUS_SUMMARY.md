## 🔧 **IN PROGRESS:**

### **Complete Game Logic Implementation**

**Status:** Ready to implement (servers running, assets ready)

**The 9 Requirements to Implement:**

1. **Card Images Display**
   - Show actual card images (not emojis)
   - Cardback flip animation
   - Correct image for each card

2. **Proper Turn Flow**
   - Draw → Roll → Stack/Continue
   - Correct button enable/disable states
   - Turn score vs Total score

3. **Dice Mechanics**
   - Fair 1-6 roll
   - Roll 1 = Bust
   - Roll 2-6 = Success, add sats

4. **Player Choices**
   - After success: Draw again OR Stack
   - Stack = Save score, pass turn

5. **Bearish Card Logic**
   - Roll to dodge
   - Even = Safe, continue
   - Odd = Penalty, turn ends
   - Three penalties: Reset, Half, -10

6. **Ape In! Mechanic**
   - Auto-draw next card
   - Value card + success = DOUBLE sats
   - Bearish = Normal logic
   - Prevent twice in row
   - Exciting message

7. **Bot AI Turns**
   - Sandy plays after player
   - Same rules apply
   - AI decision making
   - Display actions

8. **Player Name System**
   - Input modal
   - LocalStorage persistence
   - Display in game

9. **Win Conditions**
   - 150 sats (Sandy) or 300 sats (others)
   - Victory screen
   - Play again option
