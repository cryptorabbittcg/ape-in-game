# 🔧 Fix: Update ape-in-game.vercel.app to Latest Version

## ✅ Good News!

**The dice fix is working perfectly!**
Proof: https://frontend-7bc4py1y1-info-36621003s-projects.vercel.app

The ONLY issue is that your main domain isn't pointing to it yet.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

You have **two separate Vercel projects**:

```
Project "frontend" (Current deployments)
├── frontend-7bc4py1y1...vercel.app  ← LATEST ✅
├── frontend-4xnaz3p9g...vercel.app  ← Previous
└── No main domain assigned

Project "ape-in-game" (Old, not updated)
└── ape-in-game.vercel.app  ← OLD VERSION ❌
```

When you deploy, it goes to "frontend" project but the nice domain is on "ape-in-game" project!

---

## ✅ The Fix (5 Minutes via Dashboard)

### Step 1: Transfer the Domain

1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com/dashboard

2. **Click** on the **"frontend"** project (where new deploys go)

3. **Go to:** Settings → **Domains**

4. **Click:** "Add Domain"

5. **Enter:** `ape-in-game.vercel.app`

6. **Vercel will say:** "This domain is already in use by another project. Transfer it?"

7. **Click:** "Transfer Domain" or "Yes"

8. **Done!** The domain will now point to your latest deployment!

---

### Step 2: Verify

1. Wait 1-2 minutes for DNS to update
2. Visit: https://ape-in-game.vercel.app
3. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Test Sandy game - dice should work perfectly!

---

## 🔄 Going Forward

After this fix, every time you run:
```bash
cd frontend
npx vercel --prod
```

Both will update:
- ✅ New preview URL (frontend-XXXXX...)
- ✅ Main domain (ape-in-game.vercel.app)

---

## 🚀 Alternative: Deploy Directly to ape-in-game Project

If you want deployments to go directly to the ape-in-game project:

```bash
cd /home/apedev/ape-in-bot/frontend

# Unlink from "frontend" project
npx vercel unlink

# Link to "ape-in-game" project
npx vercel link
# Select: ape-in-game

# Deploy
npx vercel --prod
```

---

## 📱 For Right Now

**Share this URL** (it works perfectly):
```
https://frontend-7bc4py1y1-info-36621003s-projects.vercel.app
```

**Or update the main domain** (5 minutes via dashboard)

Then you can share:
```
https://ape-in-game.vercel.app
```

## 🎮 About localhost:3000

Firefox has Vite compatibility issues (MIME type errors).

**Try Chromium:**
1. Open Chromium
2. Go to: http://localhost:3000
3. Should work!

**Or just use Vercel** (works in all browsers)

| URL | Status | Action |

| frontend-7bc4py1y1...vercel.app | ✅ Perfect | Use now |
| ape-in-game.vercel.app | ❌ Old | Update via dashboard |

**Quick Fix:** Go to Vercel dashboard → frontend project → Settings → Domains → Add "ape-in-game.vercel.app" → Transfer domain. Done! 🎯
