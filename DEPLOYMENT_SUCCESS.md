## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

### Vercel Deployment Protection
Your deployment currently requires Vercel authentication. This is normal for new projects.

**To disable (make it public):**
- Vercel Dashboard â†’ Project â†’ Settings â†’ Deployment Protection â†’ Disable

### Render Free Tier Behavior
**Backend sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity**

**What this means:**
- First request: Takes 20-30 seconds (backend waking up)
- Subsequent requests: Instant
- This is normal for free tier

**To keep always-on:**
- Upgrade to Render Starter ($7/month)
- Or use a ping service (cron-job.org) to keep it awake
