## ⚠️ ONE THING TO DO FIRST

**For Gmail login to work, you need a Client ID:**

1. Visit: https://thirdweb.com/dashboard
2. Create/select your project
3. Copy your **Client ID**
4. Edit: `frontend/.env`
5. Add: `VITE_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here`

**Note:** The game will run without this, but you won't be able to sign in until you add it.
