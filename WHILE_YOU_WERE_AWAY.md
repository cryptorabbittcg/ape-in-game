# 🚀 Implementation Plan - Next 90 Minutes

## 📋 **WHAT I'LL COMPLETE:**

### **All 9 Game Logic Requirements:**

1. ✅ **Card Images Display**
   - Show actual card images from `/assets/cards/`
   - Use `cardback.jpg` for deck
   - Flip animation from cardback → card face

2. ✅ **Proper Turn Flow**
   - Draw card → Only "Roll Dice" enabled
   - Roll → Based on result, enable next actions
   - Proper button state management

3. ✅ **Score System**
   - Display Total Sats (permanent)
   - Display Turn Sats (current turn)
   - Update both correctly

4. ✅ **Dice Logic**
   - Roll 1 = Bust (turn ends, turn sats reset)
   - Roll 2-6 = Success (add sats, continue)
   - Fair 1-6 weighting (equal probability)

5. ✅ **Player Choices After Success**
   - Option A: Draw another card (risk it)
   - Option B: Stack sats (save & pass turn)

6. ✅ **Bearish Card Dodge**
   - Roll to dodge
   - Even (2,4,6) = Dodge, continue playing
   - Odd (1,3,5) = Penalty applies, turn ends
   - Three penalties: Reset, Half, -10

7. ✅ **Ape In! Mechanic**
   - Auto-draw next card immediately
   - If value card + successful roll = DOUBLE sats!
   - If bearish = Normal bearish logic
   - Prevent Ape In! twice in a row
   - Exciting message: "🚀 APE IN! DOUBLE SATS!"

8. ✅ **Bot (Sandy) Turn**
   - Auto-play after player turn ends
   - Display Sandy's actions
   - AI decision logic
   - Same rules apply

9. ✅ **Player Name System**
   - Input modal on first visit
   - Store in localStorage
   - Display in game and scores
