# CORS Configuration Fix - October 14, 2025

## Problem

The game was failing to start due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors. The backend was rejecting requests from the Vercel frontend.

### Symptoms
- Browser console showed CORS errors
- OPTIONS preflight requests returned 400 or 405 errors
- Game couldn't connect to backend API

## Root Cause

The CORS middleware in FastAPI was not properly configured to:
1. Allow requests from the Vercel domain (https://ape-in-game.vercel.app)
2. Handle OPTIONS preflight requests correctly
3. Use the correct settings for wildcard origins

## Solution Applied

### Changes Made

1. **backend/app/main.py** - Simplified CORS configuration:
   ```python
   app.add_middleware(
       CORSMiddleware,
       allow_origins=["*"],  # Allow all origins
       allow_credentials=False,  # Must be False when allow_origins is ["*"]
       allow_methods=["*"],  # Allow all methods including OPTIONS
       allow_headers=["*"],  # Allow all headers
   )
   ```

2. **backend/app/config.py** - Set default CORS to allow all:
   ```python
   CORS_ORIGINS: str = "*"
   ```

### Key Points

- When `allow_origins=["*"]`, `allow_credentials` MUST be `False`
- `allow_methods=["*"]` includes OPTIONS, POST, GET, etc.
- Simplified configuration is more reliable than complex conditional logic

## Verification

### Local Testing
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/game/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Origin: https://ape-in-game.vercel.app" \
  -d '{"mode":"sandy","playerName":"Test","walletAddress":null}'
```

Expected response:
- HTTP 200 OK
- Header: `access-control-allow-origin: *`
- JSON game data returned

## Deployment

1. ‚úÖ Committed changes to git
2. ‚úÖ Pushed to ape-in-game repository
3. üîÑ Render auto-deploys from GitHub (2-3 minutes)
4. ‚è≥ Vercel needs environment variable and redeploy

## Required Environment Variables

### Render Backend
```
CORS_ORIGINS=*
SECRET_KEY=production-secret-key-2024
```

### Vercel Frontend
```
VITE_API_URL=https://ape-in-game-backend.onrender.com
VITE_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=placeholder-client-id-replace-me
```

## Testing Checklist

After deployment completes:

- [ ] Visit https://ape-in-game.vercel.app/
- [ ] Open browser console (F12)
- [ ] Click "Sandy" to start a game
- [ ] Check console for any CORS errors
- [ ] Verify game loads and connects to backend
- [ ] Test drawing a card
- [ ] Test rolling dice
- [ ] Verify bot turn works

## Common Issues

### Issue: Still seeing CORS errors
- **Solution**: Wait for Render deployment to complete (check dashboard)

### Issue: Network timeout
- **Solution**: Render free tier sleeps after inactivity. First request takes 30-60 seconds.

### Issue: 404 errors
- **Solution**: Check that `VITE_API_URL` is set correctly in Vercel and redeployed.

### Issue: OPTIONS still returns 405
- **Note**: This is okay! FastAPI/Starlette may not handle OPTIONS on routes without explicit handlers, but the actual POST/GET requests work fine with CORS headers.

## Production Security Notes

For production, consider:
1. Limiting `allow_origins` to specific domains instead of `["*"]`
2. Setting up proper authentication and API keys
3. Rate limiting and DDoS protection
4. Using environment-specific CORS configs

Example for production:
```python
allow_origins=[
    "https://ape-in-game.vercel.app",
    "https://your-custom-domain.com"
]
allow_credentials=True  # Can use True when not using wildcard
```

## Status

- **Backend**: ‚úÖ Fixed and deployed
- **Frontend**: ‚è≥ Awaiting Vercel environment variable configuration
- **Game**: üîÑ Ready to test once frontend is configured
